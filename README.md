**With this code and the associated articles, you are going to:**
- Create a neural network from scratch in Python. Train it using the gradient descent algorithm.
- Apply that basic network to The Wisconsin Cancer Data-set. Predict if a tumor is benign or malignant, based on 9 different features.
- Explore deeply how back-propagation and gradient descent work.
- Review the basics and explore advanced concepts.
